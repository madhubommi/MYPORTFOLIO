## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the portfolio.
2. Customize the content in `index.html` to match your personal information.
3. Modify `style.css` to change the appearance and colors.

## Customization

### Adding Images
- **Profile Photo**: Replace `profile.jpg` in the About section with your photo (200x200px recommended)

### Changing Content
- Edit the text in `index.html` to update your name, bio, skills, and projects.
- Update the project links to point to your real projects.

### Styling
- Modify `style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout.
- Each section has a unique pastel background color.
- Change the section background colors in the CSS to match your preferences.

## Browser Support

This portfolio works in all modern browsers including:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Troubleshooting

### Images not loading
- Make sure image paths are correct relative to the HTML file.
- For the profile image, replace the placeholder URL with your actual image path.

### Form not working
- The contact form is currently static HTML. To make it functional, you'll need to add backend processing (e.g., with PHP, Node.js, or a service like Formspree).

### Mobile responsiveness issues
- Check that the viewport meta tag is present in the HTML head.
- Test on different screen sizes and adjust CSS media queries if needed.

## Deployment

To deploy this portfolio:
1. Upload all files to your web hosting service.
2. Make sure `index.html` and `style.css` are in the same directory.
3. Your portfolio will be accessible at the root URL of your hosting.
